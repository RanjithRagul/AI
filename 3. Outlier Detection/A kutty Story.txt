Imagine you're working as a data analyst at a large grocery store. You’ve collected data on the daily sales of apples from each store branch over a month. While analyzing, you notice that some stores have very low or extremely high numbers, and you’re not sure if they’re real or due to errors (like wrong input or festival rush).

You decide to detect and handle outliers so your reports reflect a more accurate and reliable picture.
