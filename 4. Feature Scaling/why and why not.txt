3 Types of Scaling (Like 3 Ways to Make Everyone Play Fair)

1. 🎓 Standardization (Z-Score Scaling)
* What it does: Makes all numbers have a center at 0 and spread out evenly.
* How? Subtract the average (mean), then divide by how much the numbers vary (standard deviation).
* Like saying: “How far is your height from the average height?”
* Use this when: Your data is balanced (no huge outliers).
* It looks like a bell curve (normal distribution).

2. Min-Max Scaling
* What it does: Shrinks all values to be between 0 and 1.
* How? Subtract the smallest number, divide by the range (biggest - smallest).
* Like saying:“Let’s make the smallest score 0 and the biggest score 1 — everything else in between!”
* Use this when: You need all features on the same scale (like in neural networks).
*Your data is in a known range without crazy outliers.

3. Robust Scaling
* What it does: Ignores extreme numbers (outliers).
* How? Uses the middle number (median) and the range between the middle 50% (called IQR).
* Like saying:“I don’t care if someone is 1000 cm tall — that’s just weird.”
* Use this when: Your data has crazy values that don’t happen often (like one super rich kid).
* You want to be less sensitive to outliers.

| Scaling Type    | Best For                  | Ignores Outliers?   | Range After Scaling       |
| --------------- | ------------------------- | -----------------   | ------------------------- |
| Standardization | Normal-shaped data        | ❌ No              | Centered at 0 (not fixed) |
| Min-Max Scaling | When you need fixed range | ❌ No              | 0 to 1                    |
| Robust Scaling  | When data has outliers    | ✅ Yes             | Around 0 (not fixed)      |



| Scenario                               | Use This Scaling |
| -------------------------------------- | ---------------- |
| Predicting height from weights and age | Standardization  |
| Feeding data into a neural network     | Min-Max          |
| Income prediction with rich outliers   | Robust Scaling   |
