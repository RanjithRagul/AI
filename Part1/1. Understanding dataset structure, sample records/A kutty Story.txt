Imagine you run a small local store and have recently started keeping 
digital records of your customers' information. One day, you want to understand 
who your customers are and how much they are spending, 
so you look at your Excel sheet that stores customer IDs, names, ages, and their last purchase amount.

You want a simple view of the records, 
like who spent the most, the average age, and total purchase amount, 
so you can plan offers better.
