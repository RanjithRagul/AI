SuperMart’s Sales Check

At SuperMart, the store manager wants to understand customer purchases. 
They have an Excel sheet where each row shows what was bought, for how much, and by whom.

The manager only wants to:
1. See items with price above ₹100
2. Remove rows where quantity is missing
3. And finally calculate the total amount per item (price × quantity)
This small cleanup will help the store get ready to build a recommendation model later.
