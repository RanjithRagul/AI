Imagine you are a manager of a busy neighborhood market. 
You’re preparing for a big sale and have collected data about your products—price, 
category, units sold, and ratings. You want to understand your data better 
to plan the best strategy.

But the challenge is: you need to first explore the data to understand 
what type each column is—like is it a number? a category? 
Then, figure out how that data is distributed—do prices mostly stay low, 
or do they vary a lot?

This process is called data type identification and distribution analysis, 
and it's one of the first and most crucial steps in AI and machine learning projects. 
Before feeding data into a model, we must understand it.


Simple Explanation:
Data Types: Whether a column contains numbers (like price), text (like product category), 
or booleans (like available or not).

Distributions: Describe how values in a column spread. For example, most prices might fall 
between 10-20 (normal), or all prices might be around 5 (uniform), or a few high prices skew 
the average (skewed distribution).
