School Report Fix

Imagine a teacher named Mrs. Anjali who maintains her students’ scores in an Excel sheet. 
However, some students forgot to write marks in a few subjects, so there are missing values.

Before submitting this sheet to the school head, she needs to clean it:

1.Remove students who skipped all subjects (drop rows).
2. If a student missed one subject, she’ll fill it using 
average marks of that subject (mean).
3.  If a whole subject is empty, she’ll remove the column (drop columns).
