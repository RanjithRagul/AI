Sarah runs a weather monitoring station in her town. Every hour, her sensors record 
temperature and humidity. However, due to occasional signal issues, some values are missing 
in her data.

Sarah needs accurate data for her monthly climate report. To fill the missing values, she 
uses two smart techniques:

KNN Imputation: Fills missing values using the most similar nearby data points.

Interpolation: Fills gaps using trends from surrounding values (like connecting dots on a 
graph).
