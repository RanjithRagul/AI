Imagine a small clinic keeps records of patient checkups in an Excel sheet. 
One of the columns is "Smoker" — whether the patient is a smoker or not. 
Some rows have missing data, while others say "Yes" or "No".

Now, the clinic is building a small system to analyze patterns in health based on 
whether a patient smokes. But the computer doesn’t understand words like “Yes” or “No” — 
it works best with numbers.

So we decide to convert this "Smoker" column into indicator variables:
1 for "Yes"
0 for "No"
And maybe NaN (missing) stays as is for now
