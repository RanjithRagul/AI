What is KNN and Interpolation?
1. KNN Imputation (K-Nearest Neighbors)
* KNN stands for K-Nearest Neighbors.
* It looks at the 'K' most similar rows (neighbors) that have complete data.
* Then it fills in the missing value using the average value from those neighbors.

Think of it like this:
If Sarah's humidity sensor missed a reading at 2 AM, KNN looks for other time points with similar temperatures and fills in the missing humidity based on those similar points.



2. Interpolation
* Interpolation fills missing values by drawing a line between known values and 
  estimating the ones in between.
* Linear interpolation assumes the values change at a constant rate between points.

Example:
If temperature at 12 AM is 22.5 and at 2 AM is 23.1, and 1 AM is missing, 
linear interpolation will assume a straight increase and fill 1 AM as 22.8.



❓Why KNN for Humidity and Interpolation for Temperature?
Humidity: Use KNN
Humidity is more non-linear and depends on other factors like temperature, time, 
and weather conditions.

Using KNN helps capture patterns in the data by looking at similar temperature profiles.
KNN adapts better when there's no clear trend, and values vary based on multiple variables.
🌡️ Temperature: Use Interpolation
Temperature changes over time are usually smooth and gradual.
It follows a natural, predictable trend — day/night cycles, weather patterns.
That makes interpolation (especially linear) a good fit.
We can safely assume that if 2 points are known, the value between them is somewhere 
in the middle.

📐 Why Use Linear Interpolation?
Linear interpolation is used because:
Simplicity – Easy to compute and interpret.
Smooth transitions – Temperature usually doesn’t change drastically in short time spans.
Predictable patterns – It assumes change is steady, which is often true for temperature 
in hourly intervals.
Better than forward/backward fill – It uses both previous and next values, not just 
one direction.

Summary
* Humidity	
* KNN Imputer	
* Depends on other variables (e.g., temperature); more scattered data

* Temperature	
* Linear Interpolation
* Follows smooth trend over time; steady, predictable changes
